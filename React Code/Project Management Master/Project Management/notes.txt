so there are few question 


app.jsx 

there is mainly two section
one is sidebar and other is menu 
so how it will be handled in app.jsx 
and how menu will be handled


so Flow is like 
01.
you when there  is no project 
then in that ccase you can start by two way 
either ty clickin on + addproject in sidebar
or create new Project in menu bar 

02. 
afte that enter title, description, and due date for particular project 
and there will be cancel and save button for obvious reason 

03. after addition of project 

initially it wil show project name (title), desccrition, and due date 
in order 
title  delete button -> to delete teh project
due date 
desccrition


[Tasks]

input field  Add Task [button]

------------------
Now when you click on add task butotn 
it willbe added into subarray and will be showing 
below the input field 

two case : 
what if there is no task 
no issue 
what if there is many task 
in that case we have to also delete also the master array as well as subarray 



-----------------
so what we are doing here is that 
fist we will style the cancle and save button and other input field 

afater that
think of a case when there is no project 
then there be one fallback condition 
in that case we need to show the ui to create a new project 

but then button should be same with button-text different 

so for htat only we will defining one new component 
with name Button and props will be children and let suppose in future there is any props associated that we will alo pass 
props can be anything some text, some number some function 
so when we will be passing that 

we can put it with Button or child component 


props -> value , function 

so that thing is
how to import image 
import any_naem from "location"
<img src = {}/>
---------------------
so now our main goal is that 
we need to render required component conditionally 

so what we can do here is that 


there are few more things 
as I was thinking that 
all projects will be stored in an array that is correct 
but the things is that 
array will be a part of object

data will be stored on App.jsx file 

why?
because that is the main compoent 
when all Parent componet is there 
and easy to use all data 
from there only 
otherwise need to use elevate state 




and also there will be three status 
undefined -> we are not adding any project
null -> we will be adding new project
or sth -> we have alredy added some project 


so on screen 
which compoent to render 

intially both NewProject and No ProjectSelected 


NoProjectSelected defaulte UI Screen at beg 
with button to add new project 


NewProject -> part of sidebar that will be helping in adding new Project 


so the flow is sth like 
in beg 
NewProject and NoProjectSelected will be shown 
and once one project is added then there is no use of NoProjectSelected 

then NewProject will be there 

projectState is the most import thing 
it will store two things 
01. status 
02. all added project 


handleStartAddProject() will be use to change the state and set the value of projectState
it will trigger in only two case 
one from NoProjectSelected and NewProject

const [projectState,setProjectState] = useState({
    selectProjectId : undefined, 
    projects : []
});

function handleStartAddProject()
{
   setProjectState((prevState) => ({...prevState, selectProjectId : null}))
}

undefined	App just loaded, nothing selected -> NoProjectSelected
null	User clicked Add Project -> NewProject

Notes: 
name of context is generally like component only 
like 
A_____B_______ that way 
anyway its more like component only 
inside that we will be wrapping the component 


we can intialise the context with any value
it may be some number, text, array, object of array 

In react version 19 or higher 
we need to use

UserContext.Provider
otherwise directly UserContext 

this provide is propery of context not user defined 

we also need to export that context 

remember the syntax 

export default ContextName

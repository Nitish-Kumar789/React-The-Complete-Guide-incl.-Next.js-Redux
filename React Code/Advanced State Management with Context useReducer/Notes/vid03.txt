Context API (React)

Context API is a React feature that lets you share data across components without prop drilling.

It allows you to pass data directly to deeply nested components.

🎯 Why We Need It?

Imagine this structure:

App → Dashboard → Sidebar → Profile


If Profile needs user data from App, normally you pass props through all levels.

With Context API, Profile can access data directly — no need to pass through Dashboard and Sidebar.

🧠 Real-Life Example

Think of Context like WiFi 📶

You don’t need wires from one room to another.
All devices connect directly to the WiFi router.

Similarly:

Context = Router

Components = Devices

🛠️ How It Works (3 Steps)
1️⃣ Create Context
import { createContext } from "react";

const UserContext = createContext();

2️⃣ Provide Context

Wrap components with Provider

<UserContext.Provider value={{ name: "Nitish" }}>
  <App />
</UserContext.Provider>

3️⃣ Consume Context
import { useContext } from "react";

const data = useContext(UserContext);

console.log(data.name);


Now any component inside Provider can access name.

🔥 When to Use Context API?

Use it for:

Logged-in user info

Theme (dark/light mode)

Language settings

Global app settings

🚫 When NOT to Use

For frequently changing data (can cause re-renders)

Very large state management → use Redux/Zustand

🆚 Context vs Prop Drilling
Prop Drilling	Context API
Pass props manually	Access directly
Messy in big apps	Cleaner structure
Hard to maintain	Centralized data

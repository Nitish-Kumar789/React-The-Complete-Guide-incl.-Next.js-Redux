there are few things that should be noted
that when we are creating the context, its always a good practice to keep a dummy sample 
so that it will give autosuggestoin 

and second things where we are wrapping the context 
at that place also, need to add like value 


Generally Hooks are not used inside 
if block and for loop 

but since in context, since we are using it some place 
so for that purpose, we can use "use" or "usecontext" 

use is more flexible and can be used inside conditional statement 

-> const cartCtx = use(CartContext)
-> const {items} = use(CartContext)



Export Type	    Import Syntax
export const	import { Name }
export default	import any name 

so with default we get freedom of name 

but with export const since we are not usign default so in that case 

we have to take same name while importing in curly braces

so coming to useReducer 
generally its used with context 
but not necessary 

so what we can do here is that 
there will be all functions bundled togher 
and identifier will be always type 
which tells what sort of action to perform 
and coming to payload, it will always 
extra data that will be sending to perform that type of actions 


so ultimately on basis of if condition 
we will perform that operation 

notes: 
useReducer doesn't reduce code 
but it bundle together function at one place

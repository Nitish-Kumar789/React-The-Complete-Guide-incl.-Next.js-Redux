there are two ways of using context value

one is using {useContext}

other ways is using 

directly wrapping all the code part into 


return (
<CartContext.Consumer>
{ (cartCtx) => {code here} }
</CartContext.Consumer>
)


but later one is not good approach we would prefer to go with useContext method only

useReducer: 

Use it when:
State depends on previous state
Multiple related state values
Complex business logic
Forms with many inputs
Cart systems 

Basic Syntax:
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

state : always current react state value, can be number, string,array, object or anything
dispatch : function to update state 
reducer : function that will decide how to change the state, it will take parameter state, and action 
so based on some action it will return latest stae 

so flow 
current state + action => latest state 

function reducer(state, action) {
  return newState;
}


initialState - its always intital value

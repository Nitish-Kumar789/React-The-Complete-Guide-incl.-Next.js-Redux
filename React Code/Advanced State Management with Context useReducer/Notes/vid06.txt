so to use context 
its three step format 

one sepearte jsx file 
for defining the template - mainly for autosuggestoin 


other for the componet where data to pass 
wrap for that component
- createContext()

where to use 
use that - useContext()


so since we are using context 
so we will aim that we will not only pass the data 
and read but also to do CRUD operations 

in simple words 
we will try to remove all props 
if we are using context 

one thing more: 
=> if useContext is wrapped around let suppose app component then it will applicable to nested, nested to nested like that way to all the nested component

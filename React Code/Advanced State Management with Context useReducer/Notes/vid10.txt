so what we will do now in the app.jsx 
we will remove all extra and context related information 
like useState, context vlaue and all functions 
let suppose in complex application 
there can be many contexts so can lead to code bloating 


-> Every component must return some JSX element[html, fragments, another component] or null

-> let suppose we are using some component and automatically children props is passed, no need to pass from parent 
component
but if you want to use then you must accpet it as {children} and later you can put that props in return statement

1. Prop Drilling (React)

Prop drilling happens when you pass data from a parent component to a deeply nested child component through multiple intermediate components — even if those middle components don’t use the data.


| Prop Drilling                    | Component Composition          |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Passing data through many levels | Passing components as children |
| Makes code tightly connected     | Makes code reusable & flexible |
| Hard to maintain in large apps   | Cleaner structure              |


so in prop driling we are passing the data via various layer 
that is un-necessary so what we can do here
we have two solution
01. component composition 
- basically we write the whole logic in app.jsx file mostly and pass that things as children componet 

and thats the downside also reason being, app.jsx may be bloated with lots of code 


--------------
In second video 
what we did, basically we shifted the code from shop.jsx to app.jsx 
and pass all contents as children to shop.jsx 


so basically we are making shop.jsx as wrapper class

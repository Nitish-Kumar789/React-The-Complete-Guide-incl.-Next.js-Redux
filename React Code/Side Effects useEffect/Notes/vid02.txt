If we want to get location of the broswer 
then there is one method provided by broswer itself 

navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition((position) => {
  const xCoord = position.coords.latitude;
  const yCoord = position.coords.longitude;
});

sideeffect are the section which is a bit independent of the main code 
main code will basically return jsx element 
help in rendering UI of the page 

but sideeffect are like some extra piece of code 
that may take time to run

useEffect doesn't return anthing 

=> it will only be executed once whole component renders 

-> number of time it will be executed depends on dependency array 
useEffect(() => {},[]) -> only once after component renders
useEffect(() => {}) ->  many times it depends when component re-renders
useEffect(() => {},[value]) -> many times , depends on how many times value changes 

=> there is one concept of fallbacktext 
let suppose we are Fetching api call, and it is taking time so meanwhile we can put some fall back text as 
fallbackText="Sorting places by distance..."

When we click on pickedupPlace, it will automatically remove from after timer of 3 second
but end user are not sure for that reason we will be using progress tag, having two main attribute 
value = {}, max= {}
value will be the current value
max will be the max value 


most of the time, it will be use with setInterval 

setInterval(() => {}, 10)

so after every 10 millisecond function body will be getting executed

its bettter to use some state here 

const [remainingTime, setRemainingTime] = useState(3000)

setInterval(() => {setRemainingTime((prevTime => prevTime - 10 ))}, 10)

also there is one issue 
it won't be stop 
so we will to use another in-built browser function 
clearInterval and bind then in useEffect



useEffect(() => {
const interval = setInterval(() => {setRemainingTime((prevTime => prevTime - 10 ))}, 10)
 
return () => { clearInterval(interval)}}, [])

so progress -> value -> max -> setInterval, clearInterval, useEffect

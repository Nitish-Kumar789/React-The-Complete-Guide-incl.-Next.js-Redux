localStorage is a function, provided by brower 
having two mthod getItem and setItem 

to set Item 


localStorage.setItem('key',JSON.stringify([]))

to getItem

localStorage.getItem('key')

since for the places 
all places id will be stored in the local storage like
"[92,10,20,1]"

so what will be doing here is that
while storing it will be like 
'[]' and while getting back using parse method, we will do like []

JavaScript Object	JSON(JavaScript object notation)
Real JS data type	String format
Used inside code	Used for data transfer
Can have functions	Cannot have functions
Keys don’t need quotes	Keys must use double quotes
Can use single quotes	Only double quotes
🎯 Simple Understanding

Think like this:

Object → Working data inside JS
JSON → Packaging format to send/store data

while use setItem - need two params one key and other value 
while use getItem - use only one param key 




object: 

{
  name: "Nitish"
}

JSON(String Format):

'{"name":"Nitish"}'

=> Here we are syncing 
React State  ↔  localStorage

and we are also managing two state 
  const [availablePlaces, setAvailablePlaces] = useState([]); => for all the places 
  const [pickedPlaces, setPickedPlaces] = useState([]); => for selected places

below is always wrong, bcz it will return undefined 
() => {} this is wrong, if we want to return sth 
like it should be like 
() => {return ...}

() => (5)this is also correct all code within parenthesis 
will be retured 
5 will be returned here 

() => ({}) returning object 

() => ({name : "nitish"})




mostly all function will return something 
or cal some some other function 
or will be used as eventListner 

🔥 Final Correct Understanding
Syntax	Returns
() => {}	undefined
() => { return 5 }	5
() => 5	5
() => (5)	5
() => ({})	object
() => {} with no return	undefined

---------------------

| Syntax               | Returns   |
| -------------------- | --------- |
| `() => {}`           | undefined |
| `() => { (5) }`      | undefined |
| `() => (5)`          | 5         |
| `() => { return 5 }` | 5         |

() => { return (5) } will return 5

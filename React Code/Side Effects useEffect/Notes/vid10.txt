so now what we are aiming is that we will 
when onDeleteConfirmation component will render 
its works is to show the dialog whenthter to delete or no 

there are two case 
01. if you manually delete the card/places by clicking on yes 
02. if automatically delete the card/place 

so after 3 second, we will delete the card 

but there are few issue 
01. Modal is always rendered but nots visible 
and because of that onDeleteConfirmation will be run and timer will start 
that we don't want 

solution in modal component
{open ? children : null}

02. let suppose we delete also then also in the backgroud 
timer is running which will initiate the deletion process that we surely not wanted 


=> 
setTimeout(() => {},30000)
useEffect(() => {}, [])

{}[function body] it will be returning undefined and thats okay
we don't care for that 
basically for these we want to run some functions

setTimeout is a browser function, we don't have to import anything 

timer expiry means timer has run for whole duration 

timer stop means before timer completes its first cycle 


template for timer and clear

useEffect( () =>  { const timer = setTimeout(() => {}, time(ms)) return () => {clearTimeout(timer);
} }, [] ) 

so effect of useEffect will only run when dependicies array in changing[not in this case]

setTimeout will be executed once that dialog will be opened 
reasoned because of useEffect it will start automatically and expired after 3 second 

clearTimeout will run just bfore jsx unamount from DOM 

sequence is import first setTimeout will run then only clearTimeout will run

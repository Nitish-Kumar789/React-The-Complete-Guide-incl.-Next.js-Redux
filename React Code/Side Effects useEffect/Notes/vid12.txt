object
array
function
date
map
set

array, function, date, map, set => internally these things are also object 

primitive data types are stored as value 
but all objects are stored as reference 


whenever we are using useEffect
like
useEffect(() => {},[fn])

so in order to avoid re-creation of function 
we will be using useCallback 

this is another hook 
and depdency array is same as useEffect

syntax is:

import {useCallback} from 'react'
const fn = useCallback(fn,[])

so callback stores the fn so that it will not be reacrated again

In this section, we will be learning what is side effect and useEffect 
where to use and where not to use 


React component is meant to be a function 
but if it doing api call, affecting local storage, dom access 
this is side effect and to handle this we have useEffect concept 
and syntax of useEffect is: 

import {useEffect} from 'react'

useEffect(() => {// side effect code here},[dependicies])
Side Effect → Something that affects outside the component.

useEffect → React Hook used to handle side effects properly.


| Side Effect         | useEffect                |

| Concept             | Hook                     |
| Any external change | Tool to handle it        |
| Example: API call   | Used to perform API call |



What is a Side Effect?

A React component is meant to be a pure function.

A pure function:

Takes input (props/state)

Returns JSX

Does not affect anything outside itself

But when a component does something like:

Making an API call

Updating localStorage

Accessing or modifying the DOM

Setting timers (setTimeout, setInterval)

Adding event listeners

👉 This is called a Side Effect.


How useEffect Works

useEffect takes two arguments:

A function → contains side effect logic

A dependency array → controls when it runs

Different Behaviors:
Dependency Array	Behavior
[]	Runs only once (on mount)
[value]	Runs when value changes
No array	Runs after every render
5️⃣ Where to Use useEffect

Use it when:

Fetching API data

Working with localStorage

Setting up timers

Subscribing to events

Manual DOM operations

6️⃣ Where NOT to Use useEffect

Do NOT use it for:

Simple state updates

Event handlers (like button click logic)

Pure calculations

Derived state that can be computed directly

If something can be done directly during render, you don’t need useEffect.

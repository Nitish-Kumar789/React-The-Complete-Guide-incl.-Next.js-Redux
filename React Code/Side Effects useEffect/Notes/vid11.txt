one component is re-rendered most important point is that
all the function is re-created not re-executed

so js consider every re-created function as different

**On every render:
A new fn function object is created
Even though code looks same**

Memory reference is different

ultimately:
=>Because functions are objects.
=>Objects are compared by reference.

so this thing is considered in useEffect(() => {} ,[fn])

let suppose because of state change or because of any reason
component re-render in that case fn will be re-created and that useEffect will be run again and again


here in this code section, we might get stuck into infinite loop 
but since we are closing the dialog thats why we are safe

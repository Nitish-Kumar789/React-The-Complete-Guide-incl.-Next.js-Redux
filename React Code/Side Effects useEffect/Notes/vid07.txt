dialog.current.showModal() 
this enables the backdrop meaning
when modal is open back element won't be interactive 


other option is like 
we can create useState()
which will be having only two value either true or false 

true means modal should be open 
false means modal shouln't be open 


and pass that props while calling Modal component 
and in the child we will be usign like 

<Modal open = {open - this will be either true or false}>
</Modal>

one thing more this is declarative way not imperative way 

and in this case background will be interactive but we can overcome that using extra fixed with some css styling

to solve this issue we will be having 

useEffect
If you use <dialog> element declaratively:

<dialog ref={dialog} open={open}>


It won’t fully behave like showModal().

So you may need:

useEffect(() => {
  if (open) {
    dialog.current.showModal();
  } else {
    dialog.current.close();
  }
}, [open]);


Now:

State controls dialog

You still use native modal behavior

Background stays non-interactive

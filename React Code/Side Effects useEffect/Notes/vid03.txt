In this section 
we want to show the availalbe place based on the current location 
so one solution will be to use useEffect
but the main issue is that 
it will stuck in infinite loop and our app will crash 
reason being: 

after one navigator call state will be updated and then again component will be render and in this process 
navigator call wil happen and state will be updated 

so our approach should be someting like 
can we change the state only once
